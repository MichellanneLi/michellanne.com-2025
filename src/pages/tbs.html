          <h2>Background</h2>

          <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
          <h3>User Dashboard</h3>
          <p>The user dashboard brings together all of the platform’s tools in one place.</p>
          <p>In user testing, employees liked that there are fewer clicks to access content compared to the existing platform.</p>
          {{> project-image 
            style='' 
            classes='has-shadow width-100' 
            img='tbs/poc/tbs-dashboard-01.png' 
            alt='tbs dashboard'
            caption='TBS Dashboard'}}

          <p>Each “module” represents a tool, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal Finance,</li>
            <li>Total rewards, and</li>
            <li>Pensions</li>
          </ul>

          {{> project-image 
            style='' 
            classes='has-shadow width-80' 
            img='tbs/poc/tbs-dashboard-finance-rewards-pension.png' 
            alt='finance, rewards, and pension modules on the tbs dashboard'
            caption='Finance, Rewards, and Pension modules'}}

          <p>To boost engagement, we included pension and health tracking apps.</p>
          <p>However, employees told us they are already using apps to track these types of metrics, so our additions have to compete or integrate with trackers such as Fitbit.</p>

          {{> project-image 
            style='' 
            classes='has-shadow width-80' 
            img='tbs/poc/tbs-dashboard-health-pension.png' 
            alt='finance, rewards, and pension modules on the tbs dashboard'
            caption='Health and Pension modules'}}

          <h3>User Feedback</h3>
          <p>After completing our proof of concept, we conducted user testing on the updated benefit enrolment flow.</p>
          <p>97% of users in Asia Pacific and 98% of users in the Europe and Middle East said the experience was simpler than before.</p>
          <p>98% of users in all markets felt the process was significantly improved.</p>
          
          <p>Users primarily care about the ease of executing core tasks, such as filing a claim and enrolling in benefits.</p>
          <p>The market is saturated with lifestyle apps and tools. Users don’t want more apps, but they are interested in aggregating their data onto a single platform.</p>
