    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>TBS is Aon's core benefits platform. It provides the underpinnings of most of our insurance enrollment websites, serving 17,000 clients and accounting for 1.4 billion in revenue.</p>
    <p>TBS was originally built in 2007. In 2020, my team was tasked with redesigning it after client feedback indicated that the existing user experience is confusing and difficult to navigate. Our clients' HR departments are overwhelmed with requests for guidance. As a result, there is concern that competitors that center user experience will threaten Aon’s market share.</p>
    <p>Our stakeholders shared with us the following concerns:</p>
    {{> blockquote 
      quote='New clients come back within a week asking for a user guide because employees are confused and don’t know how to use the site. They can’t navigate easily and reach out to the HR or contact center for help.'}}

    {{> blockquote
      quote='Big challenge for us is to try to help employees understand what benefits they should enroll in. We struggle with modelers or tools that tell people what they should buy. If we can crack this and truly help educate employees with meaningful information, we would be very successful.'}}
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>Based on this feedback, we articulated three primary goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplify the user experience by addressing friction points and offering key information at the right times. Success criteria: a reduction in poor feedback and customer service calls.</li>
      <li>Boost year-round engagement through new wellness and financial tools. Success criteria: increased usage overall and usage of these tools.</li>
      <li>Provide employers with a centralized platform to demonstrate the value of their benefits. Success criteria: improved employee retention.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
    <p>Given the scope and complexity of TBS, we identified the following challenges and constraints:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reducing friction around benefits enrollment, without being able to structure the carrier plans (Aon is an insurance brokerage, not a carrier.)</li>
      <li>Demonstrating the value of benefits and helping users choose the options that best meet their individual needs.</li>
      <li>Tailoring the platform for the Asia Pacific, Europe, and Middle East markets.</li>
      <li>Building in flexibility to account for individual client configuration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
    <p>In 2020, we conducted user research on the pain points of the existing platform and built a proof of concept.</p>
    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <p>Our team's solutions architect held user interviews with our clients' employees. They shared with him:</p>
    {{>blockquote
      quote='[TBS] can be a bit clunky. . . just getting there and remembering where options are and navigating is quite awkward. You don’t look at this system frequently enough, so you have to look for things each time. Normally use the system once a year within the benefits window. I do sometimes go in to double check and confirm my selections through the year. . . It would be good for it to be more intuitive and usable.'}}
    {{>blockquote
      quote='It is essential to be able to select benefits and options. Small bit of information with each.'}}
    <p>During the annual enrollment window, the user is prompted to enroll in next year’s benefits. Historically, the enrollment flow took a "hub and spoke" approach. The user journey began on a "shopfront" page displaying all available benefits. The user would engage with each one separately. After enrolling in a benefit, they would be directed back to the "shopfront". In order to finalize their benefit selections, the user needed to submit all of them from the "shopfront" page.</p>
    <p>This flow caused a lot of confusion. We learned from clients that employees routinely did not finalize their benefit selections because they thought they had already completed enrollment. Users told us that they had trouble understanding the steps in the enrollment process.</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-enrolment-flow--old.png' 
      alt=''
      caption=''}}
    <p>We therefore proposed a linear flow, featuring a progress bar and persistent CTAs at the bottom of the page to make the next steps clear. The user begins by selecting the benefits they want to engage with, and they are guided through the process of enrolling in each of them.</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-enrolment-flow--new-1.png' 
      alt=''
      caption=''}}
    <p>After completing our proof of concept, we conducted user testing on the updated benefit enrolment flow.</p>
    <p>97% of users in Asia Pacific and 98% of users in the Europe and Middle East said the <strong>experience was simpler than before.</strong></p>
    <p>98% of users in all markets felt <strong>the process was significantly improved.</strong></p>

    <h3>Pension Enrollment</h3>
    <p>This is the pension enrollment page. We introduced a number of decision support features to help guide the user through their selections.</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-pension-1.png' 
      alt='pension enrollment page'
      caption='Pension enrollment page'}}

    <p>The user is encouraged to increase their contribution to derive maximum benefit from their employer match.</p>

      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-pension-update-contribution-message.png' 
      alt='a message encouraging the user to update their pension contribution'}}

    <p>The interactive retirement outlook chart enables the user to see the long term impact of their contribution choices. When the user updates their contributes, the graph dynamically responds to their inputs.</p>

          <h3>Cost Summary</h3>
          <p>The cost summary helps the user understand how much they are spending on benefits. The user can expand each section to see a breakdown of their spending and their take home pay. This component dynamically updates based on the user’s selections.</p>
        </div>

    <h3>Private Medical Enrollment</h3>
    <p>This is the private medical benefit page. For private medical, the user can choose to cover dependents. They can also add or edit dependents.</p>
    <p>In testing, employees really valued the ability to add dependents on a per benefit basis, which is not something the current platform accommodates.</p>

    <h2>Initial Release</h2>
    <p>Delivery began in September 2021. The first client platform release is slated for April 2022. To that end, we are working on a minimum marketable product.</p>
    <h3>Benefit Selection</h3>
    <p>When we revisited the enrolment flow in delivery, we knew we needed to rethink the step at which the user selects their benefits. Our original proof of concept design <span class="show-for-medium">(left)</span> showed all of the benefits in every category on one page. This was overwhelming for the user. In delivery<span class="show-for-medium"> (right)</span>, we present only one category of benefits on a page at a time, thus reducing cognitive overload. This adds pages and steps to the enrollment flow, but we feel the trade-off is worth it for clients that offer dozens of benefits (clients that offer very few benefits will still display all of them on a single page.)</p>

      <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
        <div class="cell medium-6">

    <h3>Benefit Taxonomy</h3>
    <p>When a user enrolls in a benefit, the plan options available to them depend on how the carrier has structured the benefit. Because Aon brokers countless benefits with different carriers across dozens of markets, we needed to create a flexible system of displaying plan options that would work for every possible benefit permutation. This challenge is unique to TBS and sets it apart from our smaller e-commerce benefits platforms.</p>
    <p>We organized the benefit structures into categories: tiered, currency, and volume. Each benefit option is expressed as a discrete plan card that shows different information depending on the benefit structure.</p>
    <p>All plan cards display:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>the plan title, </li>
      <li>a description, </li>
      <li>participants (if relevant), </li>
      <li>costs, </li>
      <li>and a button to select the plan.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Additional information can be accessed by expanding the "More Details" and "Cost Summary" sections.</p>
    <p>In addition to the cost to the employee, we also display the cost to the employer. This is important to our clients because it demonstrates their investment in their employees' wellbeing. We also display the combined total cost because it has tax implications in the UK market.</p>
    <h4>Tiered Benefits Plan Cards</h4>
    <p>ex: bronze plan, silver plan, gold plan</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-plan-card-arch--tiered.png'

      alt='tiered plan card prototype'
      caption='tiered plan card prototype'}}
    <h4>Currency Benefits Plan Cards</h4>
    <p>ex: ???</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-plan-card-arch--currency.png' 
      alt='currency plan card wireframe'
      caption='currency plan card wireframe'}}
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-plan-card--currency.png' 
      alt='currency plan card prototype'
      caption='currency plan card prototype'}}
    <h4>Volume Benefits Plan Cards</h4>
    <p>ex: 2x salary, 3x salary, 4x salary in coverage</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-plan-card-arch--volume.png' 
      alt='volume plan card wireframe'
      caption='volume plan card wireframe'}}
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-plan-card--volume.png' 
      alt='volume plan card prototype'
      caption='volume plan card prototype'}}
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Updated Cost Summary</h3>
    <p>This is the original cost summary, covered earlier in this case study:</p>
    <div class="grid-container full">
      <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
        <div class="cell medium-6">
          {{> project-image 
            style='' 
            classes='has-shadow' 
            img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-benefit-cost-summary-1.png' 
            alt='original cost summary design'
            caption='original cost summary design'}}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>However, once we got to delivery, we learned that it would need to accommodate much more information than we had anticipated. Clients wanted to highlight employer costs in this space, and employee points spending needed to be displayed (in non-US markets, it's a practice for employers to allot points to spend on benefits.) We therefore moved this information out of the rail and into a slide-in panel.</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-annual-enrollment/tbs-enrolment-summary-cropped.png' 
      alt='new cost summary panel'
      caption='new cost summary panel'}}
