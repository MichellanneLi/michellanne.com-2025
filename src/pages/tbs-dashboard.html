          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Aon's second largest vertical is insurance brokerage, which means we work with client companies and insurance carriers to negotiate employee benefits packages. As part of this service, we offer our client companies TBS, an online benefits portal through which their employees can enroll in benefits. TBS serves 17,000 clients and accounts for 1.4 billion in revenue.</p>
          <p>TBS was originally built in 2007. Since then, market expectations have changed. In 2020, my team was tasked with redesigning it. Our stakeholders shared with us the following concerns:</p>
          {{> blockquote 
            quote='New clients come back within a week asking for a user guide because employees are confused and don’t know how to use the site. They can’t navigate easily and reach out to the HR or contact center for help.'}}
          {{> blockquote
            quote='Clients expect us to move forward and keep up with industry standards and current consumer expectations. This is shown through UX. . .'}}

          <h3>User Research</h3>
          <p>In 2020, our solutions architect conducted user research on the pain points of the existing platform. In interviews with our clients' employees, they shared with him:</p>
          {{>blockquote
            quote='[TBS] can be a bit clunky. . . just getting there and remembering where options are and navigating is quite awkward. You don’t look at this system frequently enough, so you have to look for things each time. Normally use the system once a year within the benefits window. I do sometimes go in to double check and confirm my selections through the year. . . It would be good for it to be more intuitive and usable.'}}
          {{>blockquote
            quote='It is essential to be able to select benefits and options. Small bit of information with each.'}}

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>Based on this feedback, we decided to begin with redesigning the user dashboard and articulated three primary goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Surface the tools that employees need at their fingertips. Success criteria: a reduction in poor feedback and customer service calls.</li>
            <li>Boost year-round engagement by highlighting new wellness and financial tools. Success criteria: increased usage overall and usage of these tools.</li>
            <li>Provide employers with a centralized platform to demonstrate the value of their benefits. Success criteria: improved employee retention.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
          <p>In 2020, we delivered proof of concept prototypes for the UK and Singapore markets. Our solution architect completed concept and viability testing for the APAC (Asia Pacific) and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) markets, using either in-person prototype demonstration or video demonstration, followed by a survey.</p>
          <p>Below is the UK market user dashboard. In user testing, employees liked that there are fewer clicks to access content compared to the existing platform.</p>
          {{> blockquote
            quote='I liked the transparency that employees will have on the portal also everything would be easy to track as everything is mentioned at one place.'}}

            <li>Total Rewards (or compensation),</li>

          <h3>Pensions and Health Tools</h3>
          <p>The pensions and health score modules are new features we explored to boost engagment. Clicking on the pension module opens up tools to help the user understand their retirement outlook and model the impact of changing their contributions.</p>

          <p>In user interviews, we received positive feedback for these new tools, with <strong>95.6% of users in APAC and 88% of users in EMEA agreeing that they are a value add</strong>. However, users also told us they are already using apps to track these types of metrics, so our additions have to compete or integrate with existing tools such as Fitbit. As a result, the business team decided not to move forward with these new features.</p>

          <p>Delivery began in Fall 2021. In revisiting the dashboard, we added a hero to anchor the page and to provide a space for client companies to convey their brand through photography.</p>
