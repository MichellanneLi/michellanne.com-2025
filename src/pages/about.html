        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I’m a product designer with expertise in accessibility, design systems, and front-end development. I’ve worked across a range of sectors—including academia, healthcare, and HR technology—creating digital experiences that balance usability, equity, and technical rigor.</p>
        <p>At Indeed, I redesigned the intake of education qualifications, increasing the collection of non-college education data by up to 171%. I also developed employer prompts that led to a 62% reduction in degree requirements and contributed to company-wide accessibility initiatives through research and employee engagement. My work is grounded in empathy and systems thinking, and I’m driven by a belief that thoughtful design can meaningfully connect people to opportunity.</p>
        <p>Currently based in Maryland, I earned my BFA at the Sam Fox School at Washington University in St. Louis. I originally hail from Smithville, Texas. In my free time, I enjoy cooking for my friends and family and listening to podcasts.</p>
