          <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
          <h3>User Feedback</h3>
          <p>After completing our proof of concept, we conducted user testing on the updated benefit enrolment flow.</p>
          <p>97% of users in Asia Pacific and 98% of users in the Europe and Middle East said the experience was simpler than before.</p>
          <p>98% of users in all markets felt the process was significantly improved.</p>
          
          <p>Users primarily care about the ease of executing core tasks, such as filing a claim and enrolling in benefits.</p>
          <p>The market is saturated with lifestyle apps and tools. Users don’t want more apps, but they are interested in aggregating their data onto a single platform.</p>
