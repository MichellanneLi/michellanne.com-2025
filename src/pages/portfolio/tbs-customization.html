          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Aon's second largest vertical is insurance brokering, which means we work with client companies and insurance carriers to negotiate employee benefits packages. As part of this service, we offer our client companies TBS, an online benefits portal through which their employees can enroll in benefits. TBS serves 17,000 clients and accounts for 1.4 billion in revenue.</p>
          <p>Our clients invest a great deal of time and money into articulating their visual identities, messaging, and values, and they want their employees to see these elements of their brand when they log into TBS. In the past, Aon's configuration team wrote custom CSS for every individual client site. This was an inefficient and time-consuming process, and the resulting color combinations rarely met accessibility criteria.</p>

          <h2>Customization Strategy</h2>
          <p>We took a unique approach to customization that gives clients enormous flexibility within a structured system:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Theme color: </strong>Clients can select from one of eight theme colors.</li> 
            <li><strong>Brand color: </strong>Clients can also opt to apply their brand color <em>in addition to</em> the theme color. In some places, the brand color will override the theme color. (We still use the theme palette for interactive elements, which have special accessibility requirements.) The method of applying the brand color varies depending on whether it is a light or dark hue.</li>
            <li><strong>Brand assets: </strong>Additionally, clients supply their own brand assets, such as photography and iconography.</li>
            <li><strong>Light and Dark Mode: </strong>Lastly, clients can choose to have their site in either light or dark mode.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Initially, our business stakeholders were concerned that existing clients would be dissatisfied by the constraints placed on them by this structured approach. However, we have since demoed it to several existing clients, and all of them have been very satisfied with the results.</p>
          <p>Here is a breakdown of the system:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image 
            style='' 
            classes=''
            img='tbs-theming-branding-diagram' 
            alt='Theming and Branding Diagram'
            caption='Theming and Branding Diagram'}}
        </div>
        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>Below, we highlighted areas of the website to which the theme is applied and areas to which the client brand is applied on the user dashboard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image 
            style='' 
            classes=''
            img='tbs-dashboard-theming-branding' 
            alt='The user dashboard with theming highlighted in pink and branding highlighted in green'

          <h2>Theme Colors</h2>
          <p>Each theme color represents a full palette of hues that are applied to headings, backgrounds, interactive elements, data visualizations, etc. Below is a breakdown of the navy theme:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image 
            style=''

            img='tbs-theme-navy' 
            alt='Navy theme breakdown'
            caption='Navy theme breakdown'}}
        </div>
        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>And here's what it looks like when the pallete is applied to various site components:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell"> 
          {{> project-image 
            style=''

          <h2>Branding</h2>
          <h3>Client Brand Color</h3>
          <p>If a client supplies their brand color, we apply it to select components. We have two different approaches to brand color application, depending on whether it's a darker or brighter hue.</p>
          <h3>Visual Assets</h3>
          <p>We also encourage clients to provide their own photography, icons, and other brand assets.</p>
          <p>Here's a client branded dashboard, customized with their brand color, the purple theme, and their own photography:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell"> 
          {{> project-image 
            style='fade' 
            classes='has-shadow' 
            img='tbs-dash-clientb-light' 
            alt='Client Dashboard in Light Mode'
            caption='Client Dashboard in Light Mode'}}

      <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
        <div class="cell large-10">
          <h2>Light and Dark Modes</h2>
          <p>Finally, clients can choose between light and dark mode, which impacts how their brand and theme colors are expressed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image
