    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The existing online benefits platform is confusing and difficult to navigate. Client HR departments are overwhelmed with requests for guidance. Competitors that center user experience threaten Aon’s market share.</p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplify the user experience by addressing friction points and offering key information at the right times. Success will look like a reduction in poor feedback and customer service calls.</li>
      <li>Boost year-round engagement through new wellness and financial tools. Success will look like increased usage overall and usage of these tools.</li>
      <li>Provide employers with a centralized platform to demonstrate the value of their benefits, thus increasing employee retention.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reducing friction around benefits enrollment, without being able to structure the carrier plans.</li>
      <li>Demonstrating the value of benefits and helping users choose the options that best meet their individual needs.</li>
      <li>Tailoring the platform for the Asia Pacific, Europe, and Middle East markets.</li>
      <li>Building in sufficient flexibility to account for individual client configuration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
    <h3>User Dashboard</h3>
    <p>The user dashboard brings together all of the platform’s tools in one place.</p>
    <p>In user testing, employees liked that there are fewer clicks to access content compared to the existing platform.</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow width-100' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-dashboard-01.png' 
      alt='tbs dashboard'
      caption='TBS Dashboard'}}

    <p>Each “module” represents a tool, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Finance,</li>
      <li>Total Rewards (or compensation),</li>
      <li>Pensions, and</li>
      <li>Health Score</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pensions and health tracking are new features we introduced to boost engagment. However, employees told us they are already using apps to track these types of metrics, so our additions have to compete or integrate with trackers such as Fitbit.</p>

      img='tbs/poc/tbs-dashboard-top.png' 
      alt='finance, rewards, and pension modules on the tbs dashboard'
      caption='Finance, Rewards, Pensions, and Health modules'}}

    <p>User can access both their current benefits and available anytime benefits. In user testing, this was highly valued in both the APAC and EMEA markets.</p>

    <blockquote>&#8220;Separation of the Anytime benefits and My benefits is a game changer.&#8221;</blockquote>

    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-dashboard-benefits.png' 
      alt='separate modules displaying current benefits and anytime benefits'
      caption='My Current Benefits and Available Anytime Benefits modules'}}
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Annual Enrollment</h3>
    <p>During annual enrollment, the user will be prompted to enroll in next year’s benefits.</p>
    <p>This is the pension page. We introduced a number of decision support features to help guide the user through their selections.</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-pension-1.png' 
      alt='pension enrollment page'
      caption='Pension enrollment page'}}

    <p>The user is encouraged to increase their contribution to derive maximum benefit from their employer match.</p>

    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-pension-update-contribution-message.png' 
      alt='a message encouraging the user to update their pension contribution'}}

    <p>The interactive retirement outlook chart enables the user to see the long term impact of their contribution choices. When the user updates their contributes, the graph dynamically responds to their inputs.</p>

    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-pension-chart-1.png' 
      alt='chart showing pension growth if user contributes 5 percent of their salary'}}

    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-pension-chart-2.png' 
      alt='chart showing pension growth if user contributes 6 percent of their salary'}}

    <!-- <p>The benefit cost summary helps the user understand how much they are spending on benefits. The user can expand each section to see a breakdown of their spending and their take home pay. This component dynamically updates based on the user’s selections.</p> -->

    <p>This is the private medical benefit page. For private medical, the user can choose to cover dependents. They can also add or edit dependents.</p>
    <p>In testing, employees really valued the ability to add dependents on a per benefit basis, which is not something the current platform accommodates.</p>

    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-private-medical.png' 
      alt='private medical enrollment page'
      caption='Private Medical enrollment page'}}

  <section>
    <h3>User Feedback</h3>
    <p>After completing our proof of concept, we conducted user testing on the updated benefit enrolment flow.</p>
    <p>97% of users in Asia Pacific and 98% of users in the Europe and Middle East said the <strong>experience was simpler than before.</strong></p>
    <p>98% of users in all markets felt <strong>the process was significantly improved.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Users primarily care about the ease of executing core tasks, such as filing a claim and enrolling in benefits.</p>
    <p>The market is saturated with lifestyle apps and tools. Users don’t want more apps, but they are interested in aggregating their data onto a single platform.</p>
