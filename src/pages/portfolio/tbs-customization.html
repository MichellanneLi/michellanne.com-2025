          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Aon's second largest vertical is insurance brokering, which means we work with client companies and insurance carriers to negotiate employee benefit packages. As part of this service, we offer our client companies TBS, an online benefits portal through which their employees can enroll in benefits. TBS serves 17,000 clients and accounts for 1.4 billion in revenue.</p>
          <p>Our clients invest a great deal of time and money into their branding, and they want to see their brand reflected on TBS. In the past, Aon's configuration team wrote custom CSS for every individual client site. This was an inefficient and time-consuming process, and the resulting color combinations rarely met accessibility criteria.</p>

          <h2>Customization Strategy</h2>
          <p>In response to our client's needs, we developed a unique approach to customization that provides enormous flexibility within a structured system:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Theme color: </strong>Clients can select from one of eight theme colors.</li> 
            <li><strong>Brand color: </strong>Clients can also opt to apply their brand color <em>in addition to</em> the theme color. In some places, the brand color will override the theme color. (We still use the theme palette for interactive elements, which have special accessibility requirements.)</li>
            <li><strong>Brand assets: </strong>Additionally, clients supply their own brand assets, such as photography and iconography.</li>
            <li><strong>Light and Dark Mode: </strong>Lastly, clients can choose to have their site in either light or dark mode.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here is a breakdown of the system:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image 
            style='' 
            classes=''
            img='tbs-theming-branding-diagram' 
            alt='Theming and Branding Diagram'
            caption='Theming and Branding Diagram'}}
        </div>
        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>Below, we highlighted areas of the user dashboard to which the theme is applied and areas to which the client brand is applied.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image 
            style='fade'

          <h2>Theme Colors</h2>
          <p>Each theme color represents a palette that is applied to headings, backgrounds, interactive elements, data visualizations, etc. Below is a breakdown of the green theme:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image

            alt='Green theme breakdown'
            caption='Green theme breakdown'}}
        </div>
        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>And here's what it looks like when the green theme pallete is applied to various site components:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">

          <h2>Branding</h2>
          <h3>Client Brand Color</h3>
          <p>If a client supplies their brand color, we apply it to select components. Lighter brand colors are paired with gray text, and darker brand colors are paired with white text.</p>
          <h3>Brand Assets</h3>
          <p>We also encourage clients to provide their own photography, icons, and other brand assets.</p>
          <p>Here's an article teaser, customized for two different clients:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">

          <h2>Light and Dark Modes</h2>
          <p>Choosing light mode will result in specific pieces of TBS having a white background, while choosing dark mode will result in those same pieces having a dark background. This impacts the overall mood of the site. Below is an example of how this applies to the log in page.</p>

          <h2>Client Feedback</h2>
          <p>Initially, our business stakeholders were concerned that existing clients would be frustrated by the constraints placed on them with this structured approach.</p>
          <p>To test the waters, we mocked up the website for several existing clients using our new customization system and demoed it to them on sales calls. All have been very satisfied with the results.</p>
