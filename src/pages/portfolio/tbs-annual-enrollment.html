          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Aon's second largest vertical is insurance brokering, which means we work with client companies and insurance carriers to negotiate employee benefit packages. As part of this service, we offer our client companies TBS (Total Benefits Solutions), an online benefits portal through which their employees can enroll in benefits. <strong>TBS serves 17,000 clients and accounts for 1.4 billion in revenue.</strong></p>
          <p>TBS was originally built in 2007. In 2020, my team was tasked with redesigning it after client feedback indicated that the existing user experience is confusing and difficult to navigate. Our clients' HR departments are overwhelmed with requests for guidance. As a result, there is concern that competitors that center user experience will threaten Aon’s market share.</p>
          <p>Our stakeholders shared with us the following concerns:</p>
          {{> blockquote 
            quote='New clients come back within a week asking for a user guide because employees are confused and don’t know how to use the site. They can’t navigate easily and reach out to the HR or contact center for help.'}}

          {{> blockquote
            quote='Big challenge for us is to try to help employees understand what benefits they should enroll in. We struggle with modelers or tools that tell people what they should buy. If we can crack this and truly help educate employees with meaningful information, we would be very successful.'}}

          <p><strong>Users told us that annual enrollment is their top priority on the platform.</strong> However, the existing process is so confusing that employees frequently believe they have completed benefits enrollment when, in fact, they have not submitted their elections.</p>
          {{>blockquote
            quote='It is essential to be able to select benefits and options. Small bit of information with each.'}}

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>Based on this feedback, we articulated three primary goals for improving the annual enrollment flow:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simplify the annual enrollment process by addressing friction points.</li>
            <li>Educate the user about their benefits by offering key information at the right times.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our success criteria is a reduction in poor employee feedback and customer service calls.</p>

          <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
          <p>Given the scope and complexity of TBS, we identified the following challenges and constraints:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reducing friction around benefits enrollment, without being able to impact the structure of benefits or enrollment requirements (those are dictated by the carriers.)</li>
            <li>Demonstrating the value of benefits and helping users choose the options that best meet their individual needs.</li>
            <li>Building in flexibility to account for individual configurations for each of our 17,000 clients.</li>

          <h2>User Flow</h2>
          <p>Our architect broke down the existing enrollment process and a proposed redesign, illustrated below. The product owner was concerned that the new flow would require more work in the form of clicks, so he noted the number of clicks in each user journey.</p>
          <p>The existing flow takes a "hub and spoke" approach. The user journey begins with a view of all of the benefits available to the employees, displayed as a "benefit matrix." Each benefit must be engaged with separately. After making elections for a benefit, the user is routed back to the benefit matrix. In order to complete enrollment, they must submit all of their elections from the benefit matrix page. This last step is frequently missed by employees, and the result is that many miss out on their benefits enrollment window.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="cell large-10">          
          <p>For the redesigned TBS, we proposed an approach similiar to one that had great success in the US market. This linear flow features a progress bar and CTAs in the same place on every page to make next steps clear.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image

        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>The user begins by reviewing the benefits they enrolled in the previous year. They can choose to keep, modify, or decline them. For benefits that the user wants to modify, they are guided through the process of updating their elections.</p>

        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image

            caption='Benefits from the previous year'}}
        </div> 
        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>Next, the user is shown new benefits they can enroll in for the coming year. Our proof of concept design showed all of the benefits in every category on one page. This was overwhelming and created cognitive overload.</p>
          <p>Below is the proof of concept:</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image 
            style=''

            alt='Benefits selection page v1'
            caption='Benefits selection page v1'}}
        </div>
        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>When we revisited this page in delivery, we decided to present only one category of benefits on a page at a time. After the user selects the benefits they want in a given category, they are guided through the process of enrolling in each of them. They then move on to the next category, and so forth.</p>
          <p>This change adds pages and steps to the enrollment flow, but we feel the trade-off is worth it for clients that offer dozens of benefits (clients that offer very few benefits will still display all of them on a single page.)</p>
          <p>Here is the revised version of this page:</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="cell">
          {{> project-image

        </div>
        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>When the user has finished moving through all the benefit categories, they are asked to review and submit their elections.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>After we completed our proof of concept, our architect conducted user testing on the updated annual enrollment flow. <strong>97% of users in APAC (Asia Pacific) and 98% of users in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) said the experience was simpler than before. 98% of users in all markets felt the process was significantly improved.</strong></p>

          <h2>Decision Support</h2>
          <p>Throughout annual enrollment, we introduced a number of decision support features to help guide the user through their elections.</p>

          <h3>Cost Summary</h3>
          <p>The cost summary helps the user understand how much they are spending on benefits. This component dynamically updates based on the user’s selections. In the proof of concept below, the cost summary is placed on the right side of the page. The user can expand each section to see a breakdown of their spending and their take home pay.</p>

        <div class="cell large-10">
          <p>The cost summary evolved further in delivery when we learned that it would need to accommodate much more information than anticipated. Clients want to highlight employer costs in this space, and employee points spending needs to be displayed (in non-US markets, it's a practice for employers to allot points to spend on benefits.) We therefore moved this information out of the rail and into a slide-in panel.</p>
