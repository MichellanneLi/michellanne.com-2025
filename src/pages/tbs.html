    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>My team was tasked with redesigning Aon's signature online benefits platform after client feedback indicated that the existing user experience is confusing and difficult to navigate. Our clients' HR departments are overwhelmed with requests for guidance. As a result, there is concern that competitors that center user experience will threaten Aon’s market share.</p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplify the user experience by addressing friction points and offering key information at the right times. Success will look like a reduction in poor feedback and customer service calls.</li>
      <li>Boost year-round engagement through new wellness and financial tools. Success will look like increased usage overall and usage of these tools.</li>
      <li>Provide employers with a centralized platform to demonstrate the value of their benefits, thus increasing employee retention.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Challenges and Constraints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reducing friction around benefits enrollment, without being able to structure the carrier plans.</li>
      <li>Demonstrating the value of benefits and helping users choose the options that best meet their individual needs.</li>
      <li>Tailoring the platform for the Asia Pacific, Europe, and Middle East markets.</li>
      <li>Building in flexibility to account for individual client configuration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proof of Concept</h2>
    <h3>User Dashboard</h3>
    <p>The user dashboard brings together all of the platform’s tools in one place.</p>
    <p>In user testing, employees liked that there are fewer clicks to access content compared to the existing platform.</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow width-100' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-dashboard-01.png' 
      alt='tbs dashboard'
      caption='TBS Dashboard'}}

    <p>Each “module” represents a tool, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Finance,</li>
      <li>Total Rewards (or compensation),</li>
      <li>Pensions, and</li>
      <li>Health Score</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pensions and health tracking are new features we introduced to boost engagment. However, employees told us they are already using apps to track these types of metrics, so our additions have to compete or integrate with trackers such as Fitbit.</p>

      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-dashboard-top.png' 
      alt='finance, rewards, and pension modules on the tbs dashboard'
      caption='Finance, Rewards, Pensions, and Health modules'}}

    <p>User can access both their current benefits and available anytime benefits. In user testing, this was highly valued in both the APAC and EMEA markets.</p>

    <blockquote>&#8220;Separation of the Anytime benefits and My benefits is a game changer.&#8221;</blockquote>

    {{> project-image

      alt='separate modules displaying current benefits and anytime benefits'
      caption='My Current Benefits and Available Anytime Benefits modules'}}
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Annual Enrollment</h3>
    <p>During annual enrollment, the user will be prompted to enroll in next year’s benefits.</p>
    <h4>Pension Enrolment</h4>
    <p>This is the pension page. We introduced a number of decision support features to help guide the user through their selections.</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-pension-1.png' 
      alt='pension enrollment page'
      caption='Pension enrollment page'}}

    <p>The user is encouraged to increase their contribution to derive maximum benefit from their employer match.</p>

    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-pension-update-contribution-message.png' 
      alt='a message encouraging the user to update their pension contribution'}}

    <p>The interactive retirement outlook chart enables the user to see the long term impact of their contribution choices. When the user updates their contributes, the graph dynamically responds to their inputs.</p>

    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-pension-chart-1.png'

        <div class="cell medium-6">
          <h4>Benefit Cost Summary</h4>
          <p>The benefit cost summary helps the user understand how much they are spending on benefits. The user can expand each section to see a breakdown of their spending and their take home pay. This component dynamically updates based on the user’s selections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cell medium-6">
          {{> project-image

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Private Medical Enrolment</h4>
    <p>This is the private medical benefit page. For private medical, the user can choose to cover dependents. They can also add or edit dependents.</p>
    <p>In testing, employees really valued the ability to add dependents on a per benefit basis, which is not something the current platform accommodates.</p>

    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/poc/tbs-private-medical.png'

  <section>
    <h3>User Feedback</h3>
    <p>After completing our proof of concept, we conducted user testing on the updated benefit enrolment flow.</p>
    <p>97% of users in Asia Pacific and 98% of users in the Europe and Middle East said the <strong>experience was simpler than before.</strong></p>
    <p>98% of users in all markets felt <strong>the process was significantly improved.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Users primarily care about the ease of executing core tasks, such as filing a claim and enrolling in benefits.</p>
    <p>The market is saturated with lifestyle apps and tools. Users don’t want more apps, but they are interested in aggregating their data onto a single platform.</p>

    <h2>Customization</h2>
    <p>For our clients, it's very important that TBS reflects their brands. In the past, Aon's configuration team wrote custom CSS for every individual client site. Our clients appreciated the flexibility of this approach, but it's a time-consuming process, and the resulting color combinations rarely meet accessibility criteria.</p>
    <h4>Theme Color Application</h4>
    <p>The first thing we tackled in delivery was creating a system that allows clients to customize TBS with one of 8 theme colors.</p>
    <h5>Aqua Theme Components</h5>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/delivery/tbs-theme-aqua.png' 
      alt='aqua theme components'
      caption=''}}
    <h5>Navy Theme Components</h5>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/delivery/tbs-theme-navy.png' 
      alt='navy theme components'
      caption=''}}
    <h5>Red Theme Components</h5>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs/delivery/tbs-theme-red.png' 
      alt='red theme components'
      caption=''}}
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4>Brand Color Application</h4>
    <p>Clients can also apply their brand colors to select components. We have two different approaches to brand color application, depending on whether it's a darker or brighter hue.</p>
    <h4>Light and Dark Modes</h4>
    <p>Finally, clients can choose between light and dark mode, which impacts how their brand and theme colors are expressed.</p>
    <h4>Visual Assets</h4>
    <p>We also encourage clients to provide their own photography, icons, and other brand assets.</p>
    <p>Here's a client branded dashboard in dark and light mode:</p>
    <div class="grid-container full">
      <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
        <div class="cell medium-6">
          {{> project-image 
            style='' 
            classes='has-shadow' 
            img='tbs/delivery/tbs-dash-clienta-light-mode.png' 
            alt='Client Dashboard in Light Mode'
            caption='Client Dashboard in Light Mode'}}
        </div>
        <div class="cell medium-6">
          {{> project-image 
            style='' 
            classes='has-shadow'

    <h2>Delivery (Ongoing)</h2>
    <h3>Benefit Selection</h3>
    <p>When we revisited the enrolment flow in delivery, we knew we needed to rethink the step at which the user selects their benefits. Our original proof of concept design <span class="show-for-medium">(left)</span> showed all of the benefits in every category on one page. This was overwhelming for the user. In delivery<span class="show-for-medium"> (right)</span>, we present only one category of benefits on a page at a time, thus reducing cognitive overload.</p>

    <h3>Plan Selection</h3>
    <p>When the user enrolls in a particular benefit, the way their benefit options are presented to them varies depending on how the benefit is structured by the carrier.</p>
