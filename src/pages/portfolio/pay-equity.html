          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>As a leader in risk assessment, Aon works with employers to reduce the legal and reputational risks associated with violating pay equity laws. For each client, Aon consultants conduct a 6-month audit and create a bespoke data model based on the clientâ€™s internal structures and legal requirements. From there, our consultants recommend solutions to the pay equity issues they uncover through their analysis.</p>
          <p>As part of the Pay Equity suite of services, Aon created a self-service platform where clients can track their own data and model their own solutions.</p>
          <p>Empowering clients to conduct simple tasks themselves facilitates longer, deeper relationships with Aon consultants.</p>
          <p>An MVP Pay Equity platform was released, and the development team saw a need for UX input when it was time to revisit it.</p>

          <p>Suite of web applications that enable employers to address issues with pay equity.</p>
          <p>Users can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Analyze salary data to identify pay gaps across their business.</li>
            <li>Model solutions to pay discrepancies.</li>
            <li>View and compare recommended scenarios.</li>
            <li>Calculate equitable salaries to prevent pay gaps before they happen.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>New development partner, needed to set expectations and create shared understanding of the value the UX team brings.</li>
            <li>Very short timeline.</li>
            <li>Not able to fundamentally change the data visualizations or the functionality.</li>
            <li>No direct access to users, very little access to stakeholders.</li>

The UX team was initially engaged to work on the Remediation app, but our work expanded as we built trust with the development team.
Remediation, Pay Equity Tracker, and Fair Pay Calculator launched in Q4.
