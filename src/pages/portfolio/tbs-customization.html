          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Aon's second largest vertical is insurance brokering, which means we work with client companies and insurance carriers to negotiate employee benefits packages. As part of this service, we offer our client companies TBS, an online benefits portal through which their employees can enroll in benefits. TBS serves 17,000 clients and accounts for 1.4 billion in revenue.</p>
          <p>Our clients invest a great deal of time and money into articulating their visual identities, messaging, and values, and they want their employees to see these elements of their brand when they log into TBS. In the past, Aon's configuration team wrote custom CSS for every individual client site. This was an inefficient and time-consuming process, and the resulting color combinations rarely met accessibility criteria.</p>
          <p>We took a three-tiered approach to customization:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tier 1: </strong>The client can select from one of eight theme colors and supply their own brand assets, such as photography and iconography.</li> 
            <li><strong>Tier 2: </strong>The client can choose to apply their brand color <em>in addition to</em> the theme color. In some places, the brand color will override the theme color. However, we still apply the theme color to interactive elements, which have special accessibility requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Tier 3: </strong>For clients who want a greater degree of tailoring, we can offer that level of service for a surcharge.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tier 3 was initially introduced to address concerns that clients would be dissatisfied with tiers 1 and 2. However, after providing several existing clients with mockups of the site customized with their brand color, their photography, and a theme color, all of them have been very satisfied with the results.</p>

          <p>The first thing we tackled in delivery was creating a system that allows clients to customize TBS with one of 8 theme colors.</p>

          <p>Clients can also apply their brand colors to select components. We have two different approaches to brand color application, depending on whether it's a darker or brighter hue.</p>
          <h4>Visual Assets</h4>
          <p>We also encourage clients to provide their own photography, icons, and other brand assets.</p>
