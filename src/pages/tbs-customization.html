          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Aon's bespoke employee benefits platform TBS (Total Benefits Solutions) brings together multiple HR applications and carrier data. It provides the underpinnings of most of our insurance enrollment websites, accounting for 1.4 billion in revenue.</p>
          <p>For our clients, it's very important that TBS reflects their brands. In the past, Aon's configuration team wrote custom CSS for every individual client site. This was an inefficient and time-consuming process, and the resulting color combinations rarely met accessibility criteria.</p>

          <h2>Theme Colors</h2>
          <p>The first thing we tackled in delivery was creating a system that allows clients to customize TBS with one of 8 theme colors.</p>

          <h4>Branding</h4>
          <p>Clients can also apply their brand colors to select components. We have two different approaches to brand color application, depending on whether it's a darker or brighter hue.</p>
          <h4>Visual Assets</h4>
          <p>We also encourage clients to provide their own photography, icons, and other brand assets.</p>
