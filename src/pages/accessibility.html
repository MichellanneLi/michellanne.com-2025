      <h1>Accessibility</h1>
      <p>Web accessibility is the practice of building websites and tools that take into account the needs of users with disabilities. The <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_1YR_S1810&prodType=table">2015 U.S. Census</a> found that 12.6%, or 40 million, Americans have disabilities, such as low vision and ambulatory difficulties. In the context of web accessibility, disabilities include those that are physical (such as deafness), cognitive (such as dyslexia), and situational (such as having a broken arm.)</p>
      <p>Accessibility is important to me because I see the web as an equalizer in its ability to connect people and disseminate information. My goal for this website is to achieve <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0</a> Level AA compliance. To this end, I have designed and built this site with accessibility in mind and performed manual tests using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc?hl=en-US">SiteImprove Accessibility Checker</a> and <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM Color Contrast Checker</a>.</p>
      <p>However, accessibilty requires ongoing effort. I am tracking known issues in the <a href="https://github.com/MichellanneLi/michellanne.com/issues">github repo</a>. If you have thoughts on how this site can be more accessible, I would be delighted to hear from you via github.</p>
