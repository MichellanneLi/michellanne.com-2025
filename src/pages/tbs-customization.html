    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Aon's bespoke employee benefits platform TBS (Total Benefits Solutions) brings together multiple HR applications and carrier data. It provides the underpinnings of most of our insurance enrollment websites, accounting for 1.4 billion in revenue.</p>
    <p>For our clients, it's very important that TBS reflects their brands. In the past, Aon's configuration team wrote custom CSS for every individual client site. Our clients appreciated the flexibility of this approach, but it's a time-consuming process, and the resulting color combinations rarely meet accessibility criteria.</p>
    <h4>Theme Color Application</h4>
    <p>The first thing we tackled in delivery was creating a system that allows clients to customize TBS with one of 8 theme colors.</p>
    <h5>Aqua Theme Components</h5>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-customization/tbs-theme-aqua.png' 
      alt='aqua theme components'
      caption=''}}
    <h5>Navy Theme Components</h5>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-customization/tbs-theme-navy.png' 
      alt='navy theme components'
      caption=''}}
    <h5>Red Theme Components</h5>
    {{> project-image 
      style='' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-customization/tbs-theme-red.png' 
      alt='red theme components'
      caption=''}}

    <h4>Brand Color Application</h4>
    <p>Clients can also apply their brand colors to select components. We have two different approaches to brand color application, depending on whether it's a darker or brighter hue.</p>
    <h4>Light and Dark Modes</h4>
    <p>Finally, clients can choose between light and dark mode, which impacts how their brand and theme colors are expressed.</p>
    <h4>Visual Assets</h4>
    <p>We also encourage clients to provide their own photography, icons, and other brand assets.</p>
    <p>Here's a client branded dashboard in light mode:</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='fade' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-customization/tbs-dash-clienta-light-mode.png' 
      alt='Client Dashboard in Light Mode'
      caption='Client Dashboard in Light Mode'}}
    <p>A here it is in dark mode:</p>
    {{> project-image 
      style='fade' 
      classes='has-shadow' 
      img='tbs-customization/tbs-dash-clienta-dark-mode.png' 
      alt='Client Dashboard in Dark Mode'
      caption='Client Dashboard in Dark Mode'}}
